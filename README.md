Pythonic Data Cleaning With Pandas and NumPy
1. Dropping Columns in a DataFrame.
2. Changing the Index of a DataFrame.
3. Tidying up Fields in the Data.
4. Combining str Methods with NumPy to Clean Columns.
5. Cleaning the Entire Dataset Using the applymap Function.
6. Renaming Columns and Skipping Rows.
7. Python Data Cleaning: Recap and Resources.

Data scientists spend a large amount of their time cleaning datasets and getting them down to a form with which they can work. In fact, a lot of data scientists argue that the initial steps of obtaining and cleaning data constitute 80% of the job.

Therefore, if you are just stepping into this field or planning to step into this field, it is important to be able to deal with messy data, whether that means missing values, inconsistent formatting, malformed records, or nonsensical outliers.

In this tutorial, we’ll leverage Python’s Pandas and NumPy libraries to clean data.

We’ll cover the following:

- Dropping unnecessary columns in a DataFrame
- Changing the index of a DataFrame
- Using .str() methods to clean columns
- Using the DataFrame.applymap() function to clean the entire dataset, element-wise
- Renaming columns to a more recognizable set of labels
- Skipping unnecessary rows in a CSV file
